### Project manager notes ###

The book uses the long s, which should be proofed as a regular s (the long s
looks like a f with the right hand side of the crossbar missing--see the wiki
page on [Proofing old texts][1] if you are unfamiliar with this). The OCR
usually recognizes this as f, but guiprep fixed most of them (e.g. perfon is
corrected to person); where it was unclear whether f or s is right guiprep will
have left an asterisk (e.g. `*ame` since both fame and same are valid words)
and P1 should replace the `*` with the right letter.

ct ligatures should be proofed as ct, since it is a meaningless typographical
fancy. (Similarly for st ligatures.)

It has [catchwords][2], which should be deleted.
