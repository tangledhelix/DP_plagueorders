<HTML><BODY><p>When using wordcheck, if a word or part of a word appears on the page, it is OK to suggest it.</p>
<p>The book uses the long s, which should be proofed as a regular s (the long s looks like a f with the right hand side of the crossbar missing--see the wiki page on <a href="https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/Proofing_old_texts">Proofing old texts</a> if you are unfamiliar with this). The OCR usually recognizes this as f, but guiprep fixed most of them (e.g. perfon is corrected to person); where it was unclear whether f or s is right guiprep will have left an asterisk (e.g. *ame since both fame and same are valid words) and P1 should replace the * with the right letter.</p>
<p>ct ligatures should be proofed as ct, since it is a meaningless typographical fancy. (Similarly for st ligatures.)</p>
<p>It has <a href="https://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#next_word">catchwords</a>, which should be deleted.</p>
<h4>About this book</h4>
<p>This was issued during the Great Plague of London (1665-6), the last outbreak of bubonic plague in London. Plague was spread by human fleas and lice, transfer of which usually requires close contact. The orders include social distancing, closure of theaters, quarantine of infected families, suspension of sales of second hand clothing and bedding, and more.</p></BODY></HTML>
